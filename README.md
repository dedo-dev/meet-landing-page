## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
In this challenge I learned how to work with `:has()` pseudo-class.

```css
.wrapper:has(.hero) {
  /* Some style here */
}
```

### Continued development
For future projects, I would like to learn how to work with **CUBE CSS** and improve my skills with **Semantic HTML** and **CSS**.  I want to become more confident with my knowledge and work at the pace of my mind.
